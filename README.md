# color

This is a tool to quickly convert between color formats. It's based on the [Color.js](https://colorjs.io) library and supports practically every format supported by CSS.

## Build instructions

You'll need a JavaScript runtime like [Bun](https://bun.sh).

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/noClaps/color.git
cd color
```

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```sh
bun install
bun dev
```

Build the site:

```sh
bun run build
```

This will build the site and place the output in `dist/`.
